# Arduino system

## Steps to connect
1. Connect the Breadboard power supply first, then connect the Arduino to the computer.
2. Press the button on the Breadboard power supply to start the circuit.
3. Press the button on the protoboard to start the LED.
4. If you are using a new Arduino, upload the code inside `p-Robot_Speech_Visual_Feedback/Arduino/s_HRI_audio_wave_NeoPixel/s_HRI_audio_wave_NeoPixel.ino` using the Arduino IDE.

## Components:
- Arduino UNO REV3 SMD
- NeoPixel ring 16 RGB LEDs &oslash;44.5mm
- Signal cable, unshielded, 4x 0.25 mm² grey, to connect the NeoPixel to the protoboard. Three wires are used: Ground, 5v DC, and Data input.
- Electrolytic capacitor 1000uF 6.3V 105C &oslash;8x11.5mm for the NeoPixel
- Jumper wire for breadboard - smooth 65 pcs, 
- Push button PCB 2-p on-(on) to turn on and off the prototype.
- Resistor 3W 10kohm 5% (10k) for the button
- Resistor 1W 5% 470ohm (470R) for the NeoPixel connection to the Arduino PWM Pin (6)
- Solderless Breadboard 400 tie-points
- Breadboard power supply - assembled 3,3V/5V output, with the charger Power supply 5VDC 3A 15W for the NeoPixel
