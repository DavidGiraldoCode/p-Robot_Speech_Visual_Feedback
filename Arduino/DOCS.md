# Arduino system

## Components:
- Arduino UNO REV3 SMD
- NeoPixel ring 16 RGB LEDs &oslash;44.5mm
- Signal cable, unshielded, 4x 0.25 mm² grey, to connect the NeoPixel to the protoboard. Three wires are used: Ground, 5v DC, and Data input.
- Electrolytic capacitor 1000uF 6.3V 105C &oslash;8x11.5mm for the NeoPixel
- Jumper wire for breadboard - smooth 65 pcs, 
- Push button PCB 2-p on-(on) to turn on and off the prototype.
- Resistor 3W 10kohm 5% (10k) for the button
- Resistor 1W 5% 470ohm (470R) for the NeoPixel connection to the Arduino PWM Pin (6)
- Solderless Breadboard 400 tie-points
- Breadboard power supply - assembled 3,3V/5V output, with the charger Power supply 5VDC 3A 15W for the NeoPixel
